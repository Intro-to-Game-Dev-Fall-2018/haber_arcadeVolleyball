	Since this was my first Unity project, I made many mistakes in the beginning that I had to clean up later on. For example, without knowledge of scriptableObjects or Coroutines, I ended up writing a lot of trashy code to accomplish what these tools are meant to do, and having to go back and fix it later on. However, doing this taught me a lot about good programming practices in Unity and how they differ from other languages that I am used to working with.
	Since I got the game working like the reference emulator by week 2, I wanted to experiment with additions that would teach me to be a better Unity programmer. Adding skins was my favorite exercise because I got to play with more than one different look for the game. The possibilities for skins are limitless and they were cute and fun to make. 
	The hardest challenge for me was definitely programming the play style of the AI. At first, I had it match the X position of the ball but that felt robotic and was not fun to play against. The current Ai is implemented using a simple decision tree based on the balls position and velocity, and I hope that the result is more entertaining to play against.
	Overall I am happy with the game. I've played it against many of my friends and they all seem to like it as well. It feels like a classic arcade game: it is simple enough for anyone to play and entertaining enough for people to play more than once. Within the context of this project, I feel as though I have accomplished everything I would have liked to.
